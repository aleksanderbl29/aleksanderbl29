# Hi there 👋

## 👨‍💻 About me

I am a political science student @ Aarhus University in Denmark with special interests in quantitative data analysis and voter behaviour.

In my free time I find a lot of joy in learning about Linux, Ansible and Home Assistant. A lot of things in tech pique my interest

## 📌 I'm maintaining

- A Docker container that has both Pi-Hole and Unbound in one single container.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:

- [My homelab repo](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/homelab) with configuration for the entire thing
  - Deployment of the entire homelab through [ansible](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/ansible4homelab)
- I contribute a bit to the Mac app called [Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats)
- I'm also learning R - My progress and the files for my learnings is in [Learning R](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/learning-r)
