# Hi there 👋

## 👨‍💻 About me

I am a political science student @ Aarhus University with special interests in quantitative data analysis and voter behaviour.

In my free time I find a lot of joy in learning about Linux, Docker, Ansible and Home Assistant. A lot of things in tech pique my interest

## 📌 I maintain

- [A Docker container that has both Pi-Hole and Unbound in one single container](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/docker-pihole-unbound). My rendition of the image currently has [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/aleksanderbl/pihole-unbound)](https://hub.docker.com/r/aleksanderbl/pihole-unbound)
- A couple of ansible roles
  - [HyperHDR deployment](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/ansible-role-hyperhdr)
  - [Sonos streamer for vinyl players with Icecast and Darkice](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/ansible-role-sonos-stream)

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:

- [My homelab repo](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/homelab) with configuration for the entire thing
  - Deployment of the entire homelab through [ansible](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/ansible4homelab)
- I'm also learning R - My progress and the files for my learnings is in [Learning R](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/learning-r)
- My bachelor's project - It will be available at [github.com/aleksanderbl29/bachelor](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/bachelor) when it is finished.
